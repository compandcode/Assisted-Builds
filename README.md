# Assisted-Builds
Projects/Live builds/tutorials that I've completed. I'll add comments and changes to solidify my understanding.
From the likes of Clever Programmer, Tech With Tim, Amigos Code and more!!

NOTE: For projects that aren't deployed there will be a screencast and/or the files will be available to download. Also for the React projects they're too large to put on GitHub however they will be deployed with FireBase so the links will be below.
